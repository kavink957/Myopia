    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Squint, also known as strabismus, is a visual disorder characterized by misalignment of the eyes. In squint, the eyes may not point in the same direction simultaneously, leading to one eye looking straight while the other deviates inward, outward, upward, or downward. 
        Squint can occur intermittently or persistently and can affect individuals of all ages, including infants, children, and adults.  
    </p>
    
    <h2>Causes</h2>
    Squint can have various underlying causes, including: 
    <p>
            <h4>Muscular imbalance:</h4> 
            When the muscles controlling eye movement are not working together properly, it can lead to misalignment of the eyes. 
        
           <h4>Refractive errors: </h4> 
           Conditions such as farsightedness, nearsightedness, or astigmatism can contribute to squint, especially if left uncorrected. 
    
            <h4>Neurological factors:</h4> 
            
            Certain neurological conditions or injuries affecting the brain's control of eye movements can result in squint. 
         
           <h4>Genetic predisposition:</h4> 
           
           Squint can run in families, suggesting a genetic component to its development. 
           <h4>Eye trauma or injury:</h4> 
           In some cases, trauma to the eye or surrounding structures can lead to squint. 
          
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Signs</h2>

    The primary sign of squint is the visible misalignment of the eyes. Other signs may include: 
    <p>
            <h4>Double vision:</h4> 
    
            Seeing two images of a single object. 
        
           <h4>Amblyopia (lazy eye): </h4> 
           Reduced vision in one eye due to the brain favoring the visual input from the better-aligned eye. 
            <h4>Head tilting: </h4> 
            Tilting the head to align the eyes and improve vision. 
         
           <h4>Eye strain:</h4> 
           Straining or discomfort in the eyes, especially when trying to focus. 
    
         
    </p>
    
    <h2>Symptoms</h2>
    Common symptoms associated with squint include: 

    <p>
            <h4>Visible misalignment of the eyes:</h4> 
    
            One eye may appear to turn inward, outward, upward, or downward in relation to the other eye. 
        
           <h4>Difficulty focusing:</h4> 
           Difficulty maintaining binocular vision (using both eyes together) can lead to visual confusion and strain. 
    
            <h4>Decreased depth perception: </h4> 
            
            Inability to accurately judge distances due to misaligned vision. 
        
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    Treatment for squint depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. Options may include: 
    <p>
            <h4>Eyeglasses or contact lenses:</h4> 
            Correcting refractive errors can sometimes help realign the eyes. 
        
           <h4>Vision therapy:</h4> 
           Exercises and activities aimed at improving eye coordination and focusing ability.  
    
            <h4>Eye patching: </h4> 
            Occluding the stronger eye to encourage the use of the weaker eye in cases of amblyopia. 
         
           <h4>Botulinum toxin injections:</h4> 
           In some cases, injecting botulinum toxin into specific eye muscles can help temporarily realign the eyes. 
        
           <h4>Surgery:</h4> 
           Surgical correction of the eye muscles may be necessary to realign the eyes, especially if other treatments are ineffective. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Management</h2>
    Effective management of squint involves: 
    <p>
            <h4>Early intervention: </h4> 
            Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential, especially in children, to prevent complications such as amblyopia. 
        
           <h4>Regular eye examinations:</h4> 
           Monitoring the condition and ensuring appropriate treatment adjustments as needed. 
    
            <h4>Compliance with treatment: </h4> 
            Adherence to prescribed treatments, including wearing corrective lenses or performing vision exercises. 
         
           <h4>Educational support:</h4> 
           Providing support and resources for individuals with squint to manage any associated visual difficulties in school or work settings.
