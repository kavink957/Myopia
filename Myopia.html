            <h1>Myopia</h1>
        </header>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Myopia, commonly known as nearsightedness, is a refractive error of the eye where distant objects appear blurry while close objects can be seen clearly. 
            It is a prevalent visual impairment globally, affecting individuals of all ages. 
            Myopia occurs when the eyeball is too long or the cornea is too curved, causing light rays to focus in front of the retina rather than directly on it. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Causes</h2>
        
        <p>
            Several factors contribute to the development of myopia, including genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices. Hereditary factors play a significant role, with children having myopic parents being more likely to develop the condition.
             Additionally, prolonged near work, inadequate outdoor exposure, and certain medical conditions like diabetes can increase the risk of myopia. 
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Signs</h2>
              
        <p>
            The primary sign of myopia is difficulty seeing distant objects clearly while maintaining clear vision for nearby objects.
             Individuals with myopia may squint or strain their eyes to see distant objects, and they may experience eyestrain or headaches, especially after focusing on distant objects for an extended period. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Symptoms</h2>
        Common symptoms of myopia include blurry vision when looking at distant objects, eye strain, headaches, squinting, and difficulty seeing clearly while driving or 
        participating in activities that require clear distance vision. 
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Treatment</h2>
        The treatment of myopia aims to correct vision and slow down its progression. Options include: 
        <p>
                <h4>Eyeglasses or contact lenses:</h4> 
        
                These provide clear vision by compensating for the refractive error. 
            
               <h4>Refractive surgery:</h4> 
               Procedures like LASIK or PRK reshape the cornea to correct refractive errors. 
        
                <h4>Orthokeratology:  </h4> 
                
                This involves wearing specially designed rigid contact lenses overnight to reshape the cornea temporarily. 
             
               <h4>Atropine eye drops:</h4> 
        
               Low-dose atropine eye drops may be prescribed to slow down the progression of myopia, particularly in children. 
            
        </p>
        
        <h2>Management</h2>
        Managing myopia involves a combination of lifestyle modifications and regular eye care: 
        <p>
                <h4>Regular eye exams:</h4> 
        
                Routine eye exams help monitor the progression of myopia and ensure timely adjustments to corrective measures. 
               <h4>Outdoor activities:</h4> 
               Spending time outdoors, particularly during childhood, has been associated with a reduced risk of myopia progression. 
        
                <h4>Proper lighting and posture:</h4> 
                
                Ensuring adequate lighting and maintaining good posture while reading or using digital devices can help alleviate eyestrain. 
             
               <h4>Limiting screen time: </h4> 
        
              Limiting the amount of time spent on digital devices can help reduce eye strain and potentially slow down the progression of myopia. 
       
              <h4>Following prescribed treatments:</h4> 
        
              Adhering to prescribed eyeglasses, contact lenses, or other treatments is essential for managing myopia effectively. 
            </p>
