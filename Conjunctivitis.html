    </header>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Conjunctivitis, commonly referred to as pink eye, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin, transparent membrane that covers the white part of the eye and lines the inner surface of the eyelids. 
It is a highly contagious condition that can be caused by various factors, including infections, allergies, or irritants. 
 Conjunctivitis can affect people of all ages and is characterized by redness, itching, and discharge from the eyes.
</p>

<h2>Causes</h2>

<p>
        <h4>Viral infections:</h4> 

       Common viruses, such as those responsible for the common cold,
       can cause viral conjunctivitis.
    
       <h4>Bacterial infection:</h4> 
       
       Bacteria, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, can cause bacterial conjunctivitis, 
       often resulting from poor hygiene or contact with contaminated objects.

        <h4>Allergic reactions:</h4> 
        
        Allergens like pollen, dust mites, or pet dander can trigger allergic conjunctivitis in susceptible individuals.
     
       <h4>Irritants:</h4> 
       
       Exposure to irritants like smoke, chemicals, or chlorine in swimming pools can lead to irritant conjunctivitis.
      
</p>


<h2>Signs</h2>
      
<p>
        <h4>Redness:</h4> 

        The whites of the eyes may appear pink or red due to inflammation.
    
       <h4>Itching:</h4> 
       Irritation and itching of the eyes are common symptoms, especially in cases of allergic conjunctivitis. 

        <h4>Watery discharge: </h4> 
        
        Excessive tearing or watery discharge from the eyes may be present, particularly in viral or allergic conjunctivitis.
     
       <h4>Gritty sensation:</h4> 

       A feeling of grittiness or foreign body sensation in the eyes. 

       <h4>Swelling:</h4> 

       Swelling of the eyelids or 
       conjunctiva may occur, especially in bacterial or allergic conjunctivitis.
</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Common symptoms of conjunctivitis include: 
<p>
        <h4>Eye redness:</h4> 

        The whites of the eyes may appear pink or red. 
    
       <h4>Eye itching:</h4> 
       Constant itching or irritation of the eyes. 

        <h4>Watery discharge: </h4> 
        
        Excessive tearing or watery discharge from the eyes may be present, particularly in viral or allergic conjunctivitis.
     
       <h4>Gritty sensation:</h4> 

       A feeling of grittiness or foreign body sensation in the eyes. 

       <h4>Swelling:</h4> 

       Swelling of the eyelids or 
       conjunctiva may occur, especially in bacterial or allergic conjunctivitis.
</p>


<h2>Treatment</h2>
Treatment for conjunctivitis depends on the underlying cause and may include:
<p>
        <h4>Viral conjunctivitis:</h4> 

        Typically resolves on its own without specific treatment. Cold compresses and artificial tears can help relieve symptoms. 
    
       <h4>Bacterial conjunctivitis:</h4> 
       Antibiotic eye drops or ointments may be prescribed to treat bacterial infections. 

        <h4>Allergic conjunctivitis: </h4> 
        
        Antihistamine eye drops or oral medications can help relieve itching and other allergy symptoms. Avoiding allergens is also important. 
     
       <h4>Irritant conjunctivitis:</h4> 

       Removing the irritant and rinsing the eyes with clean water can help alleviate symptoms. 

    
</p>

<h2>Management</h2>
Effective management of conjunctivitis involves: 
<p>
        <h4>Good hygiene: </h4> 

        Practicing good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing and avoiding touching the eyes, can help prevent the spread of conjunctivitis. 
    
       <h4>Avoiding irritants:</h4> 
       Minimizing exposure to known irritants or allergens can help prevent recurrent episodes of conjunctivitis. 

        <h4>Avoiding contact lenses:</h4> 
        
        Temporarily discontinuing the use of contact lenses during the course of conjunctivitis can prevent further irritation and promote healing. 
     
       <h4>Seeking medical attention: </h4> 

       Consulting an eye care professional for proper diagnosis and treatment, especially if symptoms persist or worsen.
