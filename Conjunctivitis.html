          <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Conjunctivitis, commonly referred to as pink eye, is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin, transparent membrane that covers the white part of the eye and lines the inner surface of the eyelids. 
It is a highly contagious condition that can be caused by various factors, including infections, allergies, or irritants. 
 Conjunctivitis can affect people of all ages and is characterized by redness, itching, and discharge from the eyes.
</p>

<h2>Causes</h2>

<p>
        <h4>Viral infections:</h4> 

       Common viruses, such as those responsible for the common cold,
       can cause viral conjunctivitis.
    
       <h4>Bacterial infection:</h4> 
       
       Bacteria, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, can cause bacterial conjunctivitis, 
       often resulting from poor hygiene or contact with contaminated objects.

        <h4>Allergic reactions:</h4> 
        
        Allergens like pollen, dust mites, or pet dander can trigger allergic conjunctivitis in susceptible individuals.
     
       <h4>Irritants:</h4> 
       
       Exposure to irritants like smoke, chemicals, or chlorine in swimming pools can lead to irritant conjunctivitis.
      
</p>


<h2>Signs</h2>
      
<p>
        <h4>Redness:</h4> 

        The whites of the eyes may appear pink or red due to inflammation.
    
       <h4>Itching:</h4> 
       Irritation and itching of the eyes are common symptoms, especially in cases of allergic conjunctivitis. 

        <h4>Watery discharge: </h4> 
        
        Excessive tearing or watery discharge from the eyes may be present, particularly in viral or allergic conjunctivitis.
     
       <h4>Gritty sensation:</h4> 

       A feeling of grittiness or foreign body sensation in the eyes. 

       <h4>Swelling:</h4> 

       Swelling of the eyelids or 
       conjunctiva may occur, especially in bacterial or allergic conjunctivitis.
